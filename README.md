# project written for fun
# I did these projects half a year ago, I am pretty sure I can do better right now.

# CQF_projexts
# Exam is about SVM classifier
# Final is about predicting financial series with LSTM, and my work is just a semi-finished product.
# These are going to be very confusing, I guess, with no question papers, because I am not sure whether I am allowed to upload the exam questions according to CQF institution.
# I just want to prove I have the ability to hit the ground running.
